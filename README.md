# preflex

A Clojure library for resilience, instrumentation and metrics.

**Early days. Expect breaking changes!**

_**Requires Clojure 1.7 or higher, Java 7 or higher.**_

Preflex provides the following facilities:

* Resilience
  * Thread-pool execution - provides guaranteed timeout
  * Semaphore execution - cuts off execution on overload, maintains tasks under a threshold
  * Circuit breaker - cuts off execution on repeated errors, auto-heals when error recovers
  * Fall-back execution - follows up a failed operation with fall-back operations
  * Either result - fault-handling across units of functionality
* Instrumentation
  * Success/failure tracking - tracks success/failure of an operation
  * Latency tracking - tracks latency of an operation
  * Thread-pool instrumentation - task wrapping for all stages (task submit, exec begin/end, future, shared state)
  * JDBC instrumentation - task wrapping for all stages (connection create, statement create, SQL execute)
* Metrics
  * Ordinary counters
  * Rolling (sliding-window) counters
  * Rolling (sliding-window) store
  * Sharding with metrics collection/reporting
